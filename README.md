# DEVToken
A bare-bones implementation of the Ethereum [ERC-20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), written in [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) and managed by [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), to test smart contract pipelines and verifications in the [Piccadilly instance of Blockscout](https://piccadilly.autonity.org/).

## Description
### Overview
For a contract to be fully matched and verified, the compiled bytecode must match the deployed on-chain bytecode exactly — including both:
- The runtime bytecode (what gets executed)
- The embedded compiler metadata (appended during compilation)

So, it’s not enough for the logic to be the same — everything about how the contract was compiled must match too.

## Install
### Pre-requisites
- Ensure the correct version of `solc`:
```
pip3 install solc-select
solc-select install 0.8.20
solc-select use 0.8.20
```

- This repository uses `brownie` for compilation and deployments of smart contracts, extending the [Autonity documentation on smart contract deployment](https://docs.autonity.org/developer/deploy-brownie/):
```
pipx install eth-brownie
```

- Initialisation of the `brownie` project structure:
```
brownie init
```

- Bake in the [Brownie-mix token contract template](https://github.com/brownie-mix/token-mix):
```
brownie bake
```

- Network configurations can not live in the resident `brownie-config.yaml` file, and must be updated in the `~/.brownie/network-config.yaml` with:
```
export RPC_URL=https://favourite.autonity.arc.host
brownie networks add Autonity piccadilly host=$RPC_URL chainid=65100004
```

- Ensure the `brownie` network list now contains the Autonity Piccadilly network:
```
brownie network list
```

- Adding the deployer address to `brownie`:
```
brownie console --network piccadilly
>>> account = accounts.add("DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY")
>>> print(account.address)
```

### Compile
- Compile the contracts:
```
brownie compile
```

### Deploy
- Set the `deployer` private key as an environment variable to be used by the `brownie deploy` script:
```
export DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=...
```

- Deploy the contract:
```
brownie run --network piccadilly scripts/token.py
```

- Healthy output example:
```

```

### Generating the Verification Payload
- To manually ABI-encode the `constructor_args`, update the `scripts/ethers.js`, run it to generate the ABI, and update the `curl.sh` command.
```
sudo apt install nodejs
node scripts/ethers.js
```

- The `contracts/../` `content`, is single lined solidity, with end of line characters replaced with `\n`, so for each contract copy to clipboard, and paste in the `verification_payload.json`:
```
sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/\\n/g' contracts/SafeMath.sol | xclip -selection clipboard
```
and:
```
sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/\\n/g' contracts/Token.sol | xclip -selection clipboard
```

### Contract Verification
Contract verification can carried out by both the Blockscout WebUI, and API calls. This example uses curl to call the Blockscout API. Once 
```
./curl
```
